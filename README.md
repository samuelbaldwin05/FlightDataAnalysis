# FlightDataAnalysis
Analyze flight data patterns for all flights in 2019 orginating from AZ, NV, and CA.
Data was used from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics dataset of flight data, filtering to only include the above specified information.

# Objective
The goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis on flight delays to see air traffic patterns and airline carrier patterns in the given regions.

# Key Findings
We analyzed flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics for the year 2019, focusing specifically on flights arriving or departing from Arizona, Nevada, and California. Our primary objective was to explore flight arrival/departure delays, air traffic patterns amongst different airports, and the overall performance of various airlines.

One key finding that we found was that California was evidently the state with the highest amount of overall air traffic. We came to this conclusion by analyzing the frequency of flight departure and arrivals, with which California was the highest by far. It is the largest state by area and population, which may be the reason for this.

Another key finding regarded airline performance discrepancies. There were considerable discrepancies in airline performance, with American Airlines and Frontier Airlines exhibiting the highest delays. Conversely, airlines like Delta showed better on-time performance, especially in Arizona, suggesting that regional operational strategies may impact delays.

A final finding that we found key was the correlation between flight distance and Delays. The analysis indicated a negative correlation between the distance of flights and average delays, implying that longer flights tend to be more reliable in terms of timeliness. This could reflect operational efficiencies in managing long-haul flights compared to short-haul routes, which may be affected by higher traffic congestion.

These findings highlight critical areas for improvement in the airline industry, particularly for carriers operating in high-traffic regions like California, and emphasize the importance of data analysis in enhancing operational strategies.

This projected was completed with three other group members.
